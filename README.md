# Academic Portal *for Collegiate Institutions*

## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this page is to present a description of the capabilities of the application. The features, purpose, and intended use of each aspect of the application will be discussed. This document is intended for users of the application: potentially students of a Collegiate Institution and also faculty and administrators. Vassar College has been used as a sample for this implementation, but not much would have to be changed in order to have a similarly working website for another academic institution.

### Intended Audience of this page
Typical users may include, as discussed briefly in the Purpose section: students and faculty of the academic institution.

## Overall Description

### Product Perspective
This application was developed for any student or faculty member of an academic institution who is interested in the enrollment in classes.

From a student's perspective, the application will aid in the logistical details of planning to take coursework. For example, a student will be able to, on a streamlined, cohesive web interface: see all the classes they have taken already, check for prerequisite satisfaction for an upcoming class they wish to take, make a wishlist of potential courses, and more.

From a faculty member or administrator's perspective, the capabilities range more widely depending on the role of the faculty member. The focus of this application is to provide faculty who are employed to deal with students' course registration seamless and efficient interface to streamline their workflow. Extensions of this project can potentially include an interface for professors and other such faculty to guage potential interest in classes.
